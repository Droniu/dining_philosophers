*Deadlock* is avoided by not allowing philosophers to wait for the second fork. If they pick up a fork and the second one is not available, they release the first.

*Livelock* does not occur due to the random time between changing philosphers' statuses.

*Starvation* is rare, again due to the randomness, but it can be further reduced by setting `blocking=True` parameter in `fork.acquire()` methods. It introduces a queue.
